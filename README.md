## What is glmaps?

`glmaps` is a project full of bunch of earth and map visualization examples based on Three.js and Deck.gl, as well as some tutorials for visualization beginners. Easy to learn and use. 

Watch online demo video at [YouTube](https://youtu.be/dddmamIAYj8) or [Tencent Video](https://v.qq.com/x/page/x0841840qwl.html).

## ZERO

Thanks for your attention in this project, there are some thoughts from me that you may pay attention before have future reading.

**Q: What frameworks are used in `glmaps`?**

**React Hooks** is ready in 16.8.0, and `glmaps` get benefits from it at once, if you are not familiar with it, please check [Introducing Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) first; On the other hand, deck.gl is **WebGL2** powered geospatial visualization layers, so please make sure your browser support WebGL2. To find out if WebGL(2) is enabled in your browser, go to <http://get.webgl.org/> or <https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/>. 

Besides, if you meet any errors when depoly it locally, you can describe your problem with [issues](https://github.com/hijiangtao/glmaps/issues/new), because that's most likely a problem of `glmaps` rather than yourself, since `glmaps` organizes local development environment from scratch, such as webpack, babel, etc.

**Q: Guidance for visualization beginners?**

I highly recommend you follows these steps in using `glmaps`:
  - Learn how to install three.js and deck.gl from scratch, and code your first "Hello World" with them;
  - Run official demos and get familiar with their API;
  - Follow the tutorials step by step to make your visualization examples more powerful, or check `glmaps` codes in `src` folder directly;
  - (Optional) Use `glmaps` in your demo application, start with `npm install glmaps --save`;
  - Rewrite `glmaps` example with your own codes;
  - Congratulations on mastering basics of spatio-temporal visualization, you can use `three.js` and `deck.gl` to draw a more fantastic world with spatio-temporal data!

**Q: How to participate in `glmaps` project?**

`glmaps` is still at the very beginning period of my thoughts, you are welcome to oepn ISSUE, PR or email me, if you have any ideas on how to make `glmaps` better for visualization beginners:
  - Participate in implementing tutorials together;
  - Contribute codes to `glmaps` with [PR](https://github.com/hijiangtao/glmaps/pulls) (such as imporve `mover` animation in `Globe`);
  - Speak out your doubts in learning data visualization with [issues](https://github.com/hijiangtao/glmaps/issues/new);
  - Tell me your advice on how to make `glmaps` better with [issues](https://github.com/hijiangtao/glmaps/issues/new);
  - Other aspects not included yet.

## Demo

Open browser and enter <https://localhost:8080> to check the demo locally. Please enjoy the power of `three.js` and `deck.gl`.

```
git clone https://github.com/hijiangtao/glmaps.git
cd glmaps
npm install
touch devconfigs.js
```

To use any of Mapbox's APIs, you'll need a Mapbox access token. Mapbox uses access tokens to associate requests to API resources with your account. Since TOKEN is a private key, glmaps doesn't provide it in codes, you need to specify it in file `devconfigs.js`.

Here's what an access token looks like (focus on the string starts with `pk.`, replace it with your own token. You can create your mapbox Token [here](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)) and the `devconfigs.js` file format:

```
// devconfigs.js
const MAPBOX_TOKEN = 'pk.eyJ1IjoiaGlqaWFuZ3RhbyIsImEiOiJjampxcjFnb3E2NTB5M3BvM253ZHV5YjhjIn0.WneUon5qFigfJRJ3oaZ3Ow';

export {
  MAPBOX_TOKEN,  
}
```

*Tips: You can utilize Search engine to get other's mapbox tokens if you don't want to create a new one, here's one token I got from GitHub Search: 'pk.eyJ1IjoiY3NuIiwiYSI6ImNpdnRvam1qeDAwMXgyenRlZjZiZWc1a2wifQ.Gr5pLJzG-1tucwY4h-rGdA', though it's not recommend to "steal" other's tokenâ€¦*

Save changes in `devconfigs.js` and go on:

```
npm run start
```

When `glmaps` is ready, it will open browser automatically, and render demos for you.

## Tutorials

A series of spatio-temporal data visualization tutorials that guide you how to code these visualization examples step by step. TBD.

* Visualization Tutorials from scratch (I) - Introduction of data visualization with three.js
* Visualization Tutorials from scratch (II) - Introduction of data visualization with deck.gl
* Visualization Tutorials from scratch (III) - Manage your three.js application with React
* Visualization Tutorials from scratch (IV) - Draw a earth-moon system with three.js from scratch
* Visualization Tutorials from scratch (V) - How to draw curve, mover and cube with three.js
* Visualization Tutorials from scratch (VI) - Animate your layers with props and transitions
* Visualization Tutorials from scratch (VII) - Animate your deck.gl with customized shaders
* Visualization Tutorials from scratch (VIII) - Some tips in data visualization with deck.gl and three.js

## Install

The installation is for developers who wants to use `glmaps` in their demos.

```
cd YOUR_REPO
npm install glmaps --save
```

## Usage

This is a package mainly designed for visualization lovers in learning Three.js and Deck.gl, however, you can use them as a normal package as other packages in npm.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {Globe} from 'glmaps';

/**
 * Data format:
 * [
 *   [
 *      source.lat,
 *      source.lng,
 *      target.lat,
 *      target.lng,
 *   ],
 *   ...
 * ]
 */
const Demo = (props) => {
  return (
    <Globe
      data={props.data}
      id={YOUR_MOUNT_DOM_ID}
      animate={true}
      moon={true}
      visType={'curve'}
    />
  )
};
```

More examples and detailed usage guidances can be found in documents.

## Stories

**Q: Why I create this repositry?**

A: I am really impressed by many open source developers when I learning how to visualize data on Web. They had contributed a lof of codes and resources in guiding beginners. This year, I want to take visualization as a serious work to do in my spare time. I will keep on record what I learned in my blog, at the same time I want to share more and hope my notes and codes can raise your interests in data visualization, too. Keep Simple and Love Visualization.
